# SwissDraw.jl
Swiss Draw implemented in Julia.

Julia 1.10.0 or greater is advised. 

# To install:

Download from github onto local machine. VS code with the Julia extension is advised 

run init.jl either from inside vscode, or via shell. This should download and install all the packages

Then just run main.jl and either create a new swiss draw from inital_teams.csv and field_distances.csv, or load an existing swiss draw from div2Seeding.swissdraw

The current state of the repo is rough, and design and layout elements are to be seriously  considered at a later date.
